The name of the nested class exists in the scope of the enclosing class, and name lookup from a member function of a nested class visits the scope of the enclosing class after examining the scope of the nested class. Like any member of its enclosing class, the nested class has access to all names (private, protected, etc) to which the enclosing class has access, but it is otherwise independent and has no special access to the this pointer of the enclosing class.
